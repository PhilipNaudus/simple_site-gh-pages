From the moment the movie begins, we can quickly gather that tell that Mulan is sharp-witted, a skilled hunter, and a loving daughter. Because her father is ill, Mulan decides to go hunting and returns with an impressive amount of game in hopes of restoring his apetite. When she returns, however, she is scolded by her parents for acting in such an unladylike manner. While the family is in the midst of a heated discussion, an official enters and delivers a conscription notice to Mulan's father.

That night, Mulan's parents stay up late while worrying about what to do. Just when Mulan's father resigns himself to his fate, Mulan enters and volunteers to take his place. Although her mother is strongly opposed to the idea, her father gives Mulan the chance to try on his armor. With some practice, she is able to lower her voice and immitate masculine manerisms. Because the family has no other choice, Mulan's mother finally agrees to allow her to go. The family says a tearful farewell as Mulan departs.

While on her way to Yan'an (where the soldiers will report for duty), Mulan runs into several other soldiers who begin poking fun at her soft complexion. When the teasing starts to get out of hand, a soldier by the name of Liu Yandu steps in to defend Mulan from any further harassment, but Mulan demonstrates her superior martial arts abilities and forces the bullies to back off. That night, Yandu finds Mulan standing next to the Yellow River. The two of them make coversation late into the night.

Three years later, both Mulan and Yuandu have both earned themselves prominent positions in the army. Yuandu comes to consult with Mulan and she presents a plan of attack. The two of them go before the marshal to report the secret attack. At first, he is reluctant to believe them, being that two generals have just come forward to surrender. However, he sends the two of them to go investigate further into the situation.

After accepting their orders, Mulan and Yuandu discuss how they should disguise themselves. Yuandu decides to dress as a hunter and suggests that Mulan dress as a girl. Mulan pretends that her masculine ego is insulted by the idea but eventually agrees to go along with the plan. As the two of them travel together, Yuandu begins to find himself attracted to Mulan, who is now dressed as a woman. Although Mulan pretends to be offended by his advances, she is secretly flattered to have captured his interest.

When Mulan comes across two enemy soldiers, she begins to flirt with them and entices them to boast about the strength of their army. Before they suspect anything, she quickly stabs them. When an enemy messenger happens to ride by, Mulan steals the orders he is carrying and flees back to the Chinese fortress.

Upon returning, Mulan reports that the enemy is preparing to attack; the surrendered troops which are residing inside the Chinese fortress will spring to action. Mulan warns the marshall that he must take precautions to avoid being assaulted from both inside and out. Just then, the military commander enters, discredits Mulan, and orders her to leave. Suddenly, she realizes that the commander must be taking bribes from the enemy.

The barbarians attack but Mulan has ordered her men to be ready. Sudenly, a fire breaks out from within the walls&emdash;one of the "surrendered" enemy generals is revealed to be the culprit. The military commander is revealed to have assisted the enemy and is sentenced to death. Although Mulan manages to defeat the enemy, the marshall is mortally wounded in the battle. The marshall admits that he should have listened to Mulan; his dying wish is that she be his successor.

Mulan leads the army on a series of successful expiditions and secures the victory over the enemy. The emperor offers Mulan a prominent position in the imperial court and promotes Yuandu to take Mulan's place as marshall. However, Mulan asks that she be allowed to return home. Yuandu, desiring to remain with Mulan, requests a leave of absence.

While drunk, Yuandu blurts out, "I'm in love with a girl but don't dare approach her. She is so powerful and hot-tempered that if I don't approach her respectfully enough, she will murder me!"

Countless eligible young men from Mulan's hometown eagerly await her return, but she sends them all away. Mulan resumes her feminine appearance and approaches Yuandu, who is overjoyed. Right before the film ends, we see a short clip of Mulan and Yuandu dressed as bride and groom.
