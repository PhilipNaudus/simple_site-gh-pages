Almost immediately after the release of *[Mulan: Rise of a Warrior](/pages/post_imperial/mulan_rise_of_a_warrior)*, Disney announced plans to produce their own live-action adaptation of this legend. Although little is known about this film, the [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVgdfP7qj7s) which was released in July 2019 reveals a film which, at the surface, appears to draw heavily from *Rise of a Warrior* and only retain select elements from Disney's own 1998 *[Mulan](/pages/post_imperial/disneys_mulan)*. Thus, it seems that Disney intends to produce a retelling of this classic Chinese legend which will appeal to viewers on both sides of the globe.

If Disney's efforts are successful and this American adaptation is successfully re-imported into the Chinse culture, which gave birth to Mulan's story, this will likely spark a renewed interest in the legend of Mulan throughout cultures around the world.
