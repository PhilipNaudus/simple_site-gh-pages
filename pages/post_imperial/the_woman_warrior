This classic novel is often credited with bringing Mulan's story to the West. As the daughter of Chinese immigrants, Maxine Hong Kingston often felt out of place in California's Chinatown. Kingston found solace in legends she heard from her mother, one of which was Mulan (or as Kingston calls her, Fa Mu Lan).

Up until this point, each rendition of Mulan's story introduced a new element which was included in response to a unique situation the Chinese people faced. While Kingston's retelling of Mulan's story also includes alterations, this story is mostly inspired by her personal experiences as a child living between two cultures. By combining the 1936 film Mulan Joins the Army with several other legendry figures, Kingston produced a hero with whom she could identify.

<h2>Plot Summary</h2>

Mulan's story appears in chapter two of *The Woman Warrior*. Writing from the first person, the narrator drifts in and out of a dream and begins to live out Mulan's legendary decision to take her father's place in battle.

After a group of bandits attack Mulan's village, a bird leads Mulan to a mountain where an old couple live. Mulan remains with the elderly man and woman for several years while they teach Mulan martial arts for the purpose of avenging her clan. Although Mulan misses her family, she is able to see them by looking into a magical gourd.

One day, when Mulan is looking into the gourd, she sees a messenger approach and announce that the evil baron has promised that one man from each of the families in this district will join the army.
