This classic novel is often credited with bringing Mulan's story to the West. As the daughter of Chinese immigrants, Maxine Hong Kingston often felt out of place in California's Chinatown. Kingston found solace in legends she heard from her mother, one of which was Mulan (or as Kingston calls her, Fa Mu Lan).

Up until this point, each rendition of Mulan's story introduced a new element which was included in response to a unique situation the Chinese people faced. While Kingston's retelling of Mulan's story also includes alterations, this story is mostly inspired by her personal experiences as a child living between two cultures. By combining the 1936 film Mulan Joins the Army with several other legendry figures, Kingston produced a hero with whom she could identify.
