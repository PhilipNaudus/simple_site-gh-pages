Mulan returns from the battle with an arrow wound in her shoulder. In an attempt to treat the injury, her comrades begin to rip her shirt apart. Mulan panics and refuses to allow anyone to tend to her shoulder. Ping, who is the only person who understands the true reason behind Mulan's actions, tears a whole in Mulan's shirt which is just wide enough to allow her wound to be treated without revealing her true gender.

After Mulan's shoulder has healed, the supreme commander asks to speak with her privately. He praises her for being a valiant soldier and offers to grant her whatever she desires. Mulan's only request is that she be allowed to return home to care for her elderly parents. The supreme commander agrees and, in addition, proposes to give his daughter to her in marriage. If Mulan was actually a man, she would have been flattered by this magnanimous gesture. Unable to decline the supreme commander's offer without offending him, Mulan pretends that her shoulder has suddenly become painful again to escape the awkward situation.

Throughout her time in the army, Mulan has been growing increasingly fond of General Li. Now that her time remaining with the general is limited, Mulan must reveal her true feelings or risk being forever separated from him. Mulan tries several times to cause Li to realize that she is in love with him. Despite her best efforts, Li ends up entirely confused, as he still sees Mulan as a man.

The supreme commander orders Mulan's comrades (including General Li) to accompany her home to deliver extravagant gifts in hopes that this will convince Mulan to marry the supreme commander's daughter. As soon as she has finished greeting her family, Mulan resumes her feminine appearance. Her comrades are bewildered. General Li's eyes are finally opened and he agrees to marry Mulan. However, he is still under orders to return to the supreme commander.

Mulan and General Li exchange gifts as tokens of their betrothal. As Mulan watches her lover ride off into the distance, she holds Li Guang's sword close to her chest and then raises it toward the sky.
