After the devistating conclusion to the Opium Wars, the Chinese people became increasingly disastisfied with the Qing Dynasty. An uprising ensued, which eventually resulted in the collapse of China's final dynasty. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution">Revolution of 1911</a>, the legend of Mulan was used to inspire women to join the Women's Liberation Army and fight to free China from the oppressive Qing state.

In the 1920s, the communist party begain gaining traction. The communists, who insisted on equality among all individuals, welcomed women to join their ranks. Mulan was hailed as an inspiration among women who sought to liberate themselves from China's patriarchial system and escape family duties such as arranged marriages. Whereas virtually every previous rendition of the legend emphasis that Mulan's joining the army was an incredible act of filial sacrifice, her story was now being used by women who sought personal freedom, recognition, and adventure.

When World War II (known in China as the <i>War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression</i>) broke out, women stepped into the workforce to sustain the Chinese economy while many of the country's men were at war. During this time, Zheng Meiqing assembled a team of talented artists to produce a poster which would inspire all Chinese people, both men and women, to work together in order to defeat the Japanese (shown above). No hero epitomized the artists' sentiments better than Mulan. Although some women did join the military, the vast majority of women throughout China supported the warfront by sewing uniforms and working in manufacturing plants.
