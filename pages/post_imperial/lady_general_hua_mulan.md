Mulan: "I would rather be married to you."
Li Guang: "We are brothers. How can we be married?"
Mulan: "If you turned into a woman, I would take you as my wife!"
Li Guang: "How would I become a woman? You speak in mysteries!"

<h2>Plot Summary</h2>

The film opens with Mulan returning from a successful hunting trip to find her father, Hua Hu, in shock over having received a conscription notice. Although Hua Hu was once a skilled warrior, he is now old and afraid that going on a military expidition will cost his life. Although Mulan immeditely offers to take her father's place, her parents scorn the idea.

Meanwhile, Mulan's uncle is also drafted into the army. When Mulan finds that her uncle's son, Hua Ping, is going on the expidition in place of his father, Mulan asks Ping for help. After Ping coaches Mulan on how to speak to her father, Ping approaches Hua Hu and introduces him to a "comrade" (who is actually Mulan dressed as a man). Hua Hu, who is unable to see through his own daughter's disguise, spars with Mulan and is defeated. Just as Mulan disarms her father, her hat falls to the ground. Shocked to realize that his daughter is such a skilled fighter, Hua Hu finally admits that a woman can be just as valuable as a man when it comes to defending the country.

Mulan and Ping say tearful farewells to their families. As the two of them travel together, Mulan repeatedly finds that a woman in a man's world will find herself in many awkward situations. Each time, Ping finds a way to assist her while protecting her secret. When the soldiers are expected to sleep together in the same bed, Ping fights for a separate bed and then gives it to Mulan. When the soldiers drink together, Ping insists that she refrain. Mulan naively thinks that drinking a few glasses of alcohol will establish her manliness, but the result is the men pressuring her to drink in excess. When the drunken Mulan begins to change clothes in front of the other soldiers, Ping patiently restrains her and waits for her to become sober again.

Mulan performs well in training exercises and is tasked with guarding the military warehouse. Although she expects to quickly receive further promotions, her military career begins to plateau. She confides her insecurities in General Li Guang, who assures her that all positions are equally important. Under the encouragement of General Li, Mulan begins to study flocking patterns of birds and soon learns how to infer the position of the enemy. In this way, Mulan discovers that the enemy is preparing for a nighttime ambush and alerts the supreme commander, who immediately makes preparations. Thanks to Mulan, the army avoids a major defeat and, instead, captures the enemy.

Mulan is sharp-witted, a skilled hunter, and a loving daughter. Because her father is ill, Mulan decides to go hunting and returns with an impressive amount of game in hopes of restoring his appetite. When she returns, however, she is scolded by her parents for acting in such an unladylike manner. While the family is in the midst of a heated discussion, an official enters and delivers a conscription notice to Mulan's father.

That night, Mulan's parents stay up late worrying about what to do. Just when Mulan's father resigns himself to his fate, Mulan enters and volunteers to take his place. Although her mother is strongly opposed to the idea, her father gives Mulan the chance to try on his armor. With some practice, she can lower her voice and imitate masculine mannerisms. Because the family has no other choice, Mulan's mother finally agrees to allow her to go. The family says a tearful farewell as Mulan departs.

While on her way to Yan'an (where the soldiers will report for duty), Mulan runs into several other soldiers who begin poking fun at her soft complexion. When the teasing starts to get out of hand, a soldier by the name of Liu Yuandu steps in to defend Mulan from any further harassment, but Mulan demonstrates her superior martial arts abilities and forces the bullies to back off. That night, Yuandu finds Mulan standing next to the Yellow River. The two of them make conversation late into the night.

Three years later, Mulan has earned a prominent position for herself. One day, two enemy generals come forward to surrender, but both Mulan and Yuandu are suspicious of their motives. The two of them go before the marshal, who reluctantly allows them to investigate further into the situation.

After accepting their orders, Mulan and Yuandu discuss how they should disguise themselves. Yuandu decides to pose as a hunter and suggests that Mulan dress as a girl. Mulan pretends that her masculine ego is insulted by the idea but eventually agrees to go along with the plan. As the two of them travel together, Yuandu begins to find himself attracted to Mulan, who is now dressed as a woman. Although Mulan pretends to be offended by his advances, she is secretly flattered to have captured his interest.

When Mulan comes across two enemy soldiers, she begins to flirt with them and entices them to boast about the strength of their army. Before they suspect anything, she quickly stabs them. When an enemy messenger happens to ride by, Mulan steals the orders he is carrying and flees back to the Chinese fortress.

Upon returning, Mulan reports that the enemy will soon attack; when this happens, the "surrendered" troops which are residing inside the Chinese fortress will spring into action. Mulan warns the marshall that he must take precautions to avoid being assaulted from both inside and out. Just then, the military commander enters, discredits Mulan, and orders her to leave. Suddenly, she realizes that the commander must be taking bribes from the enemy.

The barbarians attack, but Mulan has ordered her men to be ready. Suddenly, a fire breaks out from within the walls&mdash;one of the "surrendered" enemy generals is the culprit. The military commander is revealed to have assisted the enemy and is sentenced to death. Although Mulan manages to defeat the enemy, the marshall is mortally wounded in the battle. The marshall admits that he should have listened to Mulan; his dying wish is that she be his successor.

Mulan leads the army on a series of successful expeditions and secures the victory over the enemy. The emperor offers Mulan a prominent position in the imperial court and promotes Yuandu to take Mulan's place as marshall. However, Mulan asks that she be allowed to return home. Yuandu, desiring to remain with Mulan, requests a leave of absence.

Countless eligible young men from Mulan's hometown eagerly await her return, but she sends them all away. Mulan resumes her feminine appearance and approaches Yuandu, who is overjoyed. Just before the film ends, we see a short clip of Mulan and Yuandu dressed as bride and groom.
