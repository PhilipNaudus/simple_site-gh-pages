<p>Mulan Temple was once located on <a href="http://en.hubei.gov.cn/special/sinh_2015/summerresorts_2015/201507/t20150726_694712.shtml">Mulan Mountain</a> in Hubei, China. While the date of this temple&rsquo;s construction is unknown, references to it have appeared in literature dating back to the Tang Dynasty, indicating that it could have been built as early as 700 AD.</p>

<p>During the Yuan Dynasty (1332 AD), a memorial was inscribed into a large stone beside the temple. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
During the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han">Emperor Wen of Han</a>, the Xiongniu invaded the land and (the emperor) ordered that all the men under heaven be gathered together to resist them. Mulan&rsquo;s father was among those who were called upon to resist the invasion. Her father, who was extremely ill and had no son to take his place, lamented his fate.<br />
<br />
Mulan, in her bedroom chamber, pitied her father. Washing the makeup from her face and stripping herself of her pearls, she donned a military uniform and hurried to join the army. She fought valiantly and returned victoriously after twelve years. For her meritorious service, she was offered a prominent position, which she declined, saying that she wished to return to her home to and serve her parents. Emperor Wen praised her noble aspirations.<br />
<br />
She lived during the Han Dynasty is documented in the Ballad of Mulan. Later, many began to revere and worship her as a god, as recorded by the Tang Dynasty poet Du Mu.
<small><br /><a href="https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=51ZyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317">Original Chinese text</a></spall></blockquote>
<br />

<p>This memorial contains the first historical reference to Mulan by name. While earlier works of literature tell of Mulan&rsquo;s story, they are typically regarded as works which may have taken fictional or poetic license. Interestingly enough, this memorial seems to indicate that the <i>Ballad of Mulan</i> is a historical text, which counters the majority opinion among present-day scholars. (For information on why scholars doubt Mulan's historicity, see the article on the <a href="../northern_wei/ballad_of_mulan.html"><i>Ballad of Mulan</i></a>.)</p>

<p>While the fact that this memorial references the <i>Ballad of Mulan</i> is not surprising, it is interesting that Du Mu&rsquo;s <a href="../tang/mulan_temple_du_mu.html"><i>Mulan Temple</i></a> is also mentioned. Apparantly, the Taoist sect which constructed Mulan Temple used Du Mu's poem a sacred text to facilitate their worship of Mulan as a goddess.</p>
