<p>In this 100-chapter novel, Chu Renhuo&rsquo;s primary aim is to demonstrate that the rise of the Tang dynasty was mandated by heaven. The original readers would have understood that the author subtly contrasts this against the rulers of his day, with the intention of drawing the conclusion that the Qing dynasty did not have the right to rule over China. (See <a href="legend_of_mulan_qing_dynasty.html">The Legend of Mulan During the Qing Dynasty</a>.)</p>

<p>Chu Renhuo concludes Mulan&rsquo;s story with a tragic ending (which was likely inspired by historian <a href="miniscule_book_from_the_yongzhuang_studio.html">Zhu Guozhen&rsquo;s retelling</a>) to comment on the wrongdoing committed by the Manchu under whom he was forced to serve. In this novel, the Chinese are depicted as wonderfully benevolent, while the non-Chinese are evil.</p>

<p>Mulan&rsquo;s story begins in chapter 56 of <i>Romance of Sui and Tang</i>. The Tujue khan issues a draft for more men; Mulan&rsquo;s father is among those who are conscripted. Mulan, a biracial (Tujue-Chinese) teenage girl, dresses as a man and volunteers to take her father&rsquo;s place <b>to fight against the Chinese</b>. (There is an overwhelming amount of disinformation about this novel because most people who jump straight to chapter 56 to read Mulan&rsquo;s story assume that she is Chinese.)</p>

<p>The Tujue army is defeated. Mulan rescues the khan but is captured by Princess Dou Xianninang. The Chinese are such generous and loving captors that Mulan discloses her true identity to the princess and the two become sworn sisters. Feeling that her duty to the khan has been fulfilled, Mulan requests to return home in order to bring her entire family to the Chinese side.</p>

<p>Before Mulan departs, the princess entrusts her with a letter to Luo Cheng. During the previous battle, a Chinese soldier had been rescued, who holds an undelivered letter from Luo Cheng. Princess Xianniang is overjoyed to discover that the letter, addressed to a matchmaker, asks for the Xianniang&rsquo;s hand in marriage. However, she quickly realizes that the matchmaker will never be notified until the letter reaches its final destination. Because it would be inappropriate for her to deliver it herself, she writes her own letter asks Mulan to deliver it to Luo Cheng upon her return.</p>

<p>Mulan arrives at her hometown but is devastated to find that her father has passed away. When the khan hears that Mulan is a woman, he no longer feels that he owes her his life; rather, he is determined to take her as his concubine. Mulan asks to see her father&rsquo;s grave before submitting to the khan&rsquo;s demands. There, she slits her own throat, declaring that she will be loyal to no man other than her father.
Prior to her death, Mulan had entrusted Princess Xianniang&rsquo;s letter to her sister, Youlan. Youlan dresses as a man and delivers the letter to Luo Cheng. A joyful, yet somber, wedding ensues.</p>
