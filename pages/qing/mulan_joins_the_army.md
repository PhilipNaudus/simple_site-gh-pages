<h2>Act 1</h2>

The play opens with Zhao Jing, a corrupt government official, who seeks to extract bribes from men who are not willing to fulfill their military service. Because he knows that Mu Lan’s father (whose name is not mentioned in the play) is an old man with no son, he makes plans to harass the family, expecting a bribe.

Meanwhile, Mu Lan sits in her home together with her father, mother, and younger sister. Mu Lan’s father has just received his draft notice and bemoans his fate. His only hope for deliverance would be if Mu Lan’s cousin, Mu Shu, volunteered to take his place in battle.

Mu Shu was orphaned when he was a young boy and has lived together with Mu Lan’s family ever since he lost his parents. Although he shows great potential, he is lazy, undependable, and is constantly in and out of gangs. When Mu Lan’s father realizes that his fate rests with Mu Shu, he is utterly desponded.

Suddenly, Mu Shu stumbles into the door. Mu Lan and her father jump to greet Mu Shu and begin begging him to take Mu Lan’s father’s place in battle. Before Mu Shu has a chance to respond, Zhao Zhing roars onto the scene. Mu Lan’s father panics and promises that Mu Shu will take his place. Zhao Jing stomps off, upset that he did not receive a bribe.

After Zhao Jing has left, Mu Shu stubbornly refuses to report for duty. Mu Lan begs her cousin to reconsider, but he is terrified. Mu Lan begins to belittle Mu Shu, insisting that she would join the army if only she were a boy. Deeply offended for being called a coward, he challenges Mu Lan to join the army.

Mu Lan accepts the challenge. The two of them agree to exchange places. Mu Lan dresses as a man and marches off to join the army while Mu Shu dresses as a woman and tries to walk daintily.


<h2>Act 2</h2>

While Commander-in-Chief Huo Qubing is boasting of his intentions to destroy the Xiongniu (the Xiongniu are sometimes colloquially referred to as the Huns), Mu Lan enters and reports for duty. Huo Qubing takes one look at her delicate features and is about to send her away when Mu Lan (calling herself Mu Shu) begins to insist that she is a skilled warrior. Although Huo Qubing is unimpressed, he appoints her vanguard over five hundred men and threatens severe punishment if she does not prove herself to be a successful leader.

Mu Lan orders her men forward to find a battle already raging between Supreme Commander Wei Qing and the khan of the Xiongniu. Mu Lan climbs a mountain in order to understand what is happening and is startled to realize that the Chinese army is in the midst of suffering a terrible defeat. Leaping down, she rescues the supreme commander. Together, they chase the Xiongniu across the an icy sea. While attempting to conceal themselves amongst the icebergs, the entire Xiongniu army drowns. The Chinese army returns to the emperor in triumph.

The supreme commander praises Mu Lan (referring to her as Mu Shu) in front of the emperor, declaring that the victory would not have been possible without her. The emperor offers Mu Lan a prominent position but she declines, only requesting that she be allowed to return to her hometown.
