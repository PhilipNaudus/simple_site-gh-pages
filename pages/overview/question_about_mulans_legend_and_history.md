<h2>Where was Mulan born?</h2>

An inscription in a [memorial dedicated to Mulan](/pages/yuan/memorial_filial_general) located in Hebei claims to be located in Mulan’s hometown. However, Ming dynasty historian Zhu Guozhen [recorded](/pages/ming/women_generals) that Mulan was born in Bozhou. In addition, other ancient historians claim that Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei were Mulan’s birthplaces.

Most modern historians use the disagreement among imperial historians to argue that the Chinese people merely *wanted* to belive that Mulan’s story was true. However, there is little evidence to support her historicity.

<h2>Under which emperor did Mulan serve?</h2>

An inscription in a [memorial](/pages/yuan/memorial_filial_general) erected during the Yuan dynasty states that Mulan served under [Emperor Wen of Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han), who was an incredibly benevolent and virtuous ruler. The memorial describes how Mulan fought against the Xiongnu. If she served under Emperor Wen, she would have gone to war around 150 BC.

Ming dynasty historian Zhu Guozhen [wrote](/pages/ming/women_generals) that Mulan served under [Emperor Yang of Sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yang_of_Sui) who ruled from 569–618 AD. Emperor Yang was incredibly corrupt, and gave no thought to have raped thousands of virgin girls during his reign. After he died, it has been said to have been relocated several times due to consecutive ligning strikes. According to Zhu Guozhen’s account, Emerpror Yang sought to take Mulan as a concubine, but she took her own life to preserve her honor.

Most modern historians believe that Mulan’s story is ficticious, but insist that it takes place during the era of Northern Wei, most likely serving under [Emperor Taiwu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taiwu_of_Northern_Wei) because Taiwu engaged in a twelve-year war between 429–441 AD (the *[Ballad of Mulan](/pages/northern_wei/ballad_of_mulan)* states that Mulan returned home twelve years after being drafted). Because it was not beneath Emperor Taiwu to compel elderly men to join his army (he won battles through attrition), it is possible that a young girl would have been forced to take her father’s place to save his life during the reign of this corrupt warlord.

<h2>How did Mulan die?</h2>

According to Ming dynasty historian Zhu Guozhen’s [account](/pages/ming/women_generals) of Mulan’s life:

<blockquote>
When the royal court finally heard about Mulan’s true nature, Emperor Yang offered her a position in the royal harem. Again, Mulan declined, saying, “Your humble servant is unworthy of this honor.” When the emperor tried to take her by force, and she realized that she could not resist his demands, she ended her own life.

Emperor Yang was greatly moved by how fiercely loyal she was to defending her family and her chastity. Thus, he posthumously promoted her to general and added “filial” to her title. This is why she is now known as The Filial General.
</blockquote>

<h2>Did Mulan have a brother or a sister?</h2>

The *[Ballad of Mulan](/pages/northern_wei/ballad_of_mulan)* states that Mulan had a younger brother.

Additionally, the Ming dynasty play *[Mulan Joins the Army](/pages/ming/mulan_joins_the_army_xu_wei)* and the Qing dynasty novel *[Fierce and Filial](/pages/qing/fierce_and_filial)* state that Mulan had a nine-year-old sister by the name of Munan and a five-year-old brother by the name Hua Fang (who was nicknamed Yaoer).

<h2>How old was Mulan when she joined the army? How long did she serve?</h2>

Most retellings indicate that Mulan was a teenager. Only *[Fierce and Filial](/pages/qing/fierce_and_filial)* mentions her exact age—seventeen years old. Because she served for twelve years, she would have returned at the age of twenty-nine.

<h2>Who was the enemy Mulan fought against?</h2>

The only historical text to explicitly mention Mulan’s enemy is a [memorial](/pages/yuan/memorial_filial_general) erected during the Song dynasty. According to the inscription, Mulan fought against the Xiongnu.

The Ming dynasty play *[Mulan Joins the Army](/pages/ming/mulan_joins_the_army_xu_wei)* was the first to give the villain a name: Leopard Skin. The Qing dynasty novel *[Fierce and Filial](/pages/qing/fierce_and_filial)* described Leopard Skin as the leader of the [Black Mountain bandits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_Bandits).
