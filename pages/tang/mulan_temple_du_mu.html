<p>Although this poem is only four lines long, it is filled with vivid imagery which depicts Mulan&rsquo;s inner struggle. Deep down inside, she remains a woman. However, her circumstances force her to act as a man. Will she be true to her inner feminine nature or lose herself and become a hardened warrior?</p>

<p>As the poem concludes, Du Mu compares Mulan to <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/wang-zhaojun-beauty-of-peace_1069045.html">Wang Zhaojun</a>, one of the four most beautiful women who ever lived in ancient China. Like Mulan, Wang Zhaojun&rsquo;s virtue forced her to make incredible sacrifices and endure many years of isolation.</p>

<p>Because this poem employs beautiful rhetoric which is extremely difficult to express in another language, a literal translation is nearly impossible. A paraphrase appears below:</p>

<blockquote style="text-align: left;">
The warrior boldly enters battle and draws her bow.<br />
<div class="indent">
Suddenly, she enters a trance. Her clothes, hair, and makeup are transformed. There she stands, beautifully adorned as a woman.</div>
<br />
Does she dare drink together with the officers?<br />
<div class="indent">
Deep in the heart of inner Mongolia, they all raise their glasses to the beautiful princess (Wang Zhaojun).</div>
<small><a href="https://fanti.dugushici.com/ancient_proses/27451">Original Chinese text</a></small>
</blockquote>
<br />

<p>The fact that this poem is titled <i>Mulan Temple</i> seems suprising. After all, the poem itself has nothing to do with a temple. <a href="../yuan/memorial_filial_general.html">A memorial which was erected during the Yuan Dynasy</a> reveals that this poem was used as a sacred text by a Taoist sect which revered Mulan as a goddess. These Taoists were probably the ones who chose the title for this poem.</p>
