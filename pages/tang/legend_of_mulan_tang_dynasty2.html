						<p>Shortly after the formation of the Tang Dynasty, Empress Wu rose to power. This woman&rsquo;s sovereign reign over all of China, unsurprisingly, had a profound impact on the society&rsquo;s opinion of women. However, because culture is often slow to adapt, it was not until after Empress Wu&rsquo;s death that authors began portraying women in a more positive light.</p>

						<p>As the female protagonist became increasingly acceptable in literature, retellings of Mulan&rsquo;s story abounded. However, the modern perception of Mulan being a stong warrior did not develop until much later. Wei Yuanfu&rsquo;s Song of Mulan, the most progressive of the four Tang Dynasty poems about Mulan, simply mentions that a battle occurred and a victory ensured. Because the culture was not yet prepared to accept a woman warrior, poets could only hint at Mulan&rsquo;s strength and valor.</p>

						<p>Early renditions of Mulan&rsquo;s story almost exclusively focused on Mulan&rsquo;s beauty, elegance, and virtue. The most popular retelling, Du Mu&rsquo;s Mulan Temple, depicts Mulan as agonizing over whether it would be appropriate for her to drink together with the other officers. Even while dressed as a man, she struggled to act in a way that was becoming for a lady.</p>

						<p>Although these depictions of Mulan may seem disappointingly anti-feminist to the modern reader, they mark a revolutionary shift in Chinese ideology. Previously, Ban Zhao had insisted that &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s worth lies in his strength while a woman&rsquo;s beauty stems from her inferiority&rdquo; (<a href="https://zh.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%A5%B3%E8%AA%A1">女誡</a>). As the status of women gradually rose, poets challenged the culture with the story of Mulan, yet assured readers that a woman who becomes strong will not lose her beauty or virtue. Mulan, the most filial daughter, was heralded as the perfect woman.</p>
