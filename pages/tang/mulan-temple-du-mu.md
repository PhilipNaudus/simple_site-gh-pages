Although this poem is only four lines long, it is filled with vivid imagery which depicts Mulan&rsquo;s inner struggle. Deep down inside, she remains a woman. However, her circumstances force her to act as a man. Will she be true to her inner feminine nature or lose herself and become a hardened warrior?

As the poem concludes, Du Mu compares Mulan to [Wang Zhaojun](https://www.theepochtimes.com/wang-zhaojun-beauty-of-peace_1069045.html), one of the four most beautiful women who ever lived in ancient China. Like Mulan, Wang Zhaojun&rsquo;s virtue forced her to make incredible sacrifices and endure many years of isolation.

Because this poem employs beautiful rhetoric, which is extremely difficult to express in another language, a literal translation is nearly impossible. A paraphrase appears below:

<blockquote style="text-align: left;">
The warrior boldly enters battle and draws her bow.<br />
<div class="indent">
Suddenly, she enters a trance. Her clothes, hair, and makeup are transformed. There she stands, beautifully adorned as a woman.</div>
<br />
Does she dare drink together with the officers?<br />
<div class="indent">
Deep in the heart of inner Mongolia, they all raise their glasses to the beautiful princess (Wang Zhaojun).</div>

</blockquote>

The title of this poem was most likely chosen by the followers of a Taoist sect who began to use this poem as one of their sacred texts (see [A Memorial to the Filial General]).
