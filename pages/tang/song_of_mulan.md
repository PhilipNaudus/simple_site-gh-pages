The *Song of Mulan*, composed by Wei Yuanfu, is strikingly similar to the *Ballad*. Like the *Ballad*, this song is also quite short, although it introduces several key elements which eventually became intrinsic to the legend.

Because the *Ballad* failed to explain why Mulan found it necessary to take her father's place, Wei Yuanfu decided to mention that her father was old, in poor health, and his condition had been steadily deteriorating.

When Mulan returns home, she she has strips herself of her manly garments and resumes her appearane as a petite woman. By returning to her proper place as a woman, she does not challenge geneder roles; however, she does insist that a daughter is just as valuable as a son.

The *Song* concludes that all the officials of this world should learn from Mulan's example. Any man who would be as devoted and as virtuous as Mulan would certainly become a famous historical figure who would be revered throughout the ages.

<h2>English Translation</h2>

<blockquote>
Mulan sighs while holding the weaver's shuttle.<br />
<div class="indent">“Who is on your heart this time?” I ask.</div><br />
I wish to know the reason behind her sadness.<br />
<div class="indent"> She takes a deep breath and composes herself.</div><br /><br />

(Mulan replies)<br />
“My father has been drafted into the army,<br />
<div class="indent"> But he is has no strength.</div><br />
How can he join this expedition and march 10,000 miles?<br />
<div class="indent"> His son is still too young to take his father’s place.</div><br />
His horse will stumble through the deep sand.<br />
<div class="indent"> The fierce wind attack his skin.</div><br />
My father is old and ill.<br />
<div class="indent"> How will he be able to endure these hardships?”</div><br /><br />

Mulan will take her father’s place.<br />
<div class="indent"> She feeds her horse and take her place among the soldiers.</div><br />
She removes her silk clothes.<br />
<div class="indent"> She washes away her makeup.</div><br />
She rides a horse and reports for duty.<br />
<div class="indent"> Her heart is filled with courage.</div><br />
At dawn, she pitches her tent at the foot of a snowy mountain.<br />
<div class="indent"> At dusk, she rests beside a clear lake.</div><br />
By nightfall, she attacks Mt. Yanzhi.<br />
<div class="indent"> She also captures the Qiang.</div><br />
The general has won the victory.<br />
<div class="indent"> The soldiers can now return home.</div><br /><br />

Mulan is greeted by her parents.<br />
<div class="indent"> But joy turns into sadness.</div><br />
Mulan understands the expressions on her parents’ faces.<br />
<div class="indent"> She lays aside her manly garments and prepares to sing.</div><br /><br />

(Mulan sings)<br />
“I was a valliant hero,<br />
<div class="indent"> But now I am a petite woman once again.</div><br />
Relatives bring me their congratulations.<br />
<div class="indent"> A daughter is just as valuable as a son!”</div><br /><br />

Her old comrades wait outside<br />
<div class="indent"> They shared many hardships together for ten years.</div><br />
They have sworn to be brothers for life,<br />
<div class="indent"> As they have even faced death together.</div><br />
Today, they see Mulan again.<br />
<div class="indent"> Although they recognize her voice, her appearance is completely different!</div><br />
They dare not approach her,<br />
<div class="indent">as they are perplexed</div><br />
If the officials of this world<br />
<div class="indent">could display the same virtue as Mulan,</div><br />
Their loyalty and filial piety would not be lost.<br />
<div class="indent"> Their fame would last throughout the ages.</div><br />
