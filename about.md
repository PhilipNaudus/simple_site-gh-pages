				<p>Hi, my name is Philip Naudus. I’m a Chinese translator.</p>
				<p>I’m an American living in Taiwan. I’m married and have two kids. I have moved around the globe several times and am still trying to figure out where I belong.</p>
				<p>One of the best perks about living in Taiwan is being able to explore the abandoned corners of libraries. I enjoy reading very old Chinese novels because they open my horizons to a fascinating culture that is different from the one I grew up with.</p>
				<p>I have read over a dozen retellings of the Mulan legend in the original Chinese, and have made this website to share my knowledge with you.</p>
