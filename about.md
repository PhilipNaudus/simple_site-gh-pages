				<p>Hi, I’m Philip Naudus. I'm an American living in Taiwan with my wife and two kids. (Here in Taiwan, I go by Shengwen Hsu.)</p>
				<p>Because I’m close to National Taiwan University, I enjoy visiting their archives. I wish I could say I’m a scholar, but I am one of the few people who visit the abandoned treasures in the back corner of the library. It is in the compressed stacks that I discovered a whole new world.</p>
				<p>I have read over a dozen retellings of the Mulan legend in the original Chinese, and have made this website to share my knowledge with you.</p>
				<p>If you would like to contact me, please <a href="/pages/overview/contact">click here</a>.
