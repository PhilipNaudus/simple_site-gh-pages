<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We will not collect any personal data about you or track you <b>unless you explicitly request us to do so</b>.</p>

<h2>Why would I want to volunteer to be tracked?</h2>

<p>Tracking visitors helps us better understand which pages are the most popular. Without tracking visitors, it's hard to discern the difference between 100 people viewing a page and a single person hitting refresh 100 times. <b>But we're not going to track you without your explicit request.</b> It's totally up to you.</p>
