				<h1>Lingjian</h1>
				<p>A <em>lingjian</em> (&#20196;&#31661;) was a token of authority officers used to authorize their subordinates to carry out essential tasks. It is sometimes called a "command arrow" because the general's command was written on it, and it was shaped like an arrow.</p>
				<p>Little is known of how a <em>lingjian</em> was used in ancient China (once an order was completed, the authorizing <em>lingjian</em> may have been destroyed). However, a few of them that have survived may shed light onto how they were used.</p>
				<p>Between 1929 and 1943, a survey was conducted on ethnic people and cultural relics throughout Yunan. The Yunnan Gongshan Administration Bureau wanted to guarantee safe passage to a man by the name of Tao Yunkui, and gave him the <em>lingjian</em> shown below.</p>

				<p>On the <em>lingjian</em> is written the business Tao Yunkui had come to conduct, along with what accommodations would be needed during his journey. There is one notch on the top right, indicating that this has been authorized by one entity (the administration bureau). Additionally, there are eight small notches on the bottom left, indicating that the cooperation of eight people are required to guarantee Tao Yunkui's safe passage (in this case, the eight people were needed to serve as escorts).</p>
				<p>The purpose of the notches was to guarantee that the instructions could not be altered. For instance, if a <em>lingjian</em> only had three notches in the bottom left, but the message commanded an entire battalion of men to cooperate, the authenticity of the <em>lingjian</em> could be challenged.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, a <em>lingjian</em> needed to be authorized by more than one person (for instance, if the sender was commanding a person to travel outside of his jurisdiction). In this case, a second notch would be cut in the top right corner.</p>
				<p>In the <em>lingjian</em> below, two notches have been cut in the top right.</p>

				<p>The first notch on the top right is from the sender, and the second notch indicates that additional authorization was acquired. Additionally, the five notches in the bottom left indicate that five people were needed to comply with the order.</p>
				<p>A <em>lingjian</em> could be used to authorize anything within the sender's authority. It is possible that such authorizations could include releasing wartime prisoners, allowing passage through restricted areas, or ordering troops forward. As noted earlier, very little is known about the use of <em>lingjian</em> in ancient China because so few of them have survived to the present. An officer would likely want to write specific instructions on the <em>lingjian</em> to prevent the bearer from performing actions that the sender did not authorize. However, it is possible that an officer could craft a <em>lingjian</em> that would give the bearer complete freedom to make decisions on the sender's behalf.</p>
